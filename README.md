# Intruder and Animal Detection System

This project is an AI-powered **Intruder and Animal Detection System** that uses YOLOv8, YOLOv5, and Face Recognition to detect intruders, identify family members, and detect animals near your property. It also provides real-time alerts via Telegram and triggers automated alarms based on detected threats.

## Features

âœ… **Intruder Detection:** Uses YOLOv5 to detect people in the live camera feed.
âœ… **Face Recognition:** Identifies family members and flags unknown individuals.
âœ… **Animal Detection:** Uses YOLOv8 to detect animals like dogs, cats, and elephants.
âœ… **Telegram Alerts:** Sends alerts with detected images to a Telegram bot.
âœ… **MongoDB Storage:** Stores detection logs, timestamps, and alert history.
âœ… **Alarm System:** Triggers different alarm sounds for different detected animals.
âœ… **Multi-threading:** Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for improved performance.
